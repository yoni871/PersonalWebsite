                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p> My name is Yonatan Demissie. I was born and raised in the vibrant and culturally rich country of Ethiopia. 
                    At a young age, I embarked on a life-changing adventure that brought me to the heart of the United States. 
                    Adapting to a new land came with its challenges, from overcoming language barriers to navigating a complete 
                    cultural change. However, I persevered, putting in dedicated effort to acclimate to the new environment. 
                    Presently, I'm in my senior year of pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Texas Tech university 
                    located in Lubbock Texas.</p>
                <p>Outside of my academic pursuits, I have a real love for music. Playing different musical instruments brings me 
                    joy and a way to express myself. Whether it's strumming a guitar or getting into the groove with a drum, music 
                    is a big part of my life. My passion for music also expands into sports, with a particular passion for soccer, 
                    and I also enjoy playing basketball.</p>
                <P>As I look to the future, my primary goal is to secure a job in my field of computer science, where I can apply 
                    and further develop my skills. However, my aspirations extend beyond personal success. I am determined to use 
                    my knowledge and expertise to give back to my roots in Ethiopia and other underdeveloped areas. My ultimate dream 
                    is to create a system that facilitates easy access to computers and software skills in third-world countries, 
                    particularly in underprivileged schools. By doing so, I hope to contribute to a brighter future for those who face 
                    limited opportunities, just as I once did. </P>

                <div class="left-part">
                    <h4>DESCRIPTION:</h4>
                    <p>As a passionate developer with a keen interest in providing practical solutions, 
                        I embarked on a personal project to create a weather app that empowers users with 
                        real-time weather information. This project reflects my dedication to enhancing
                         user experiences and my commitment to staying updated with the latest technologies.</p>

                    <h4>KEY FEATURES:</h4>

                         <p>Real-Time Weather Data:<br> 
                         The app leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display up-to-date weather information for cities worldwide.
                         </p>
                    
                         <h4>User-Friendly Interface:</h4>
                         <p>With a clean and intuitive user interface, the app allows 
                         users to effortlessly search for weather conditions in their desired locations.</p>

                         <h4>Temperature Units: </h4>
                        <p>Users can toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit to view temperature data in their preferred units.</p>

                        <h4>Dynamic Background Images: </h4>
                        <p>The app dynamically updates its background image based on the current weather conditions, creating 
                        an immersive and visually appealing experience.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="right-part">
                        <h4>TECHNOLOGIES USED:</h4>

                        <p>JavaScript: The app's core functionality is powered by JavaScript, enabling seamless data retrieval and manipulation.</p>
                        <p>HTML/CSS: A well-structured HTML and CSS layout ensures a responsive and aesthetically pleasing design.</p>
                        <p>API Integration: The project showcases my ability to integrate external APIs into web applications, providing valuable data to users.</p>

                        <h4>CHALLENGES AND LEARNING:</h4>

                        <p>Throughout this project, I encountered various challenges, from handling API responses to optimizing the user interface for different devices. These challenges allowed
                        me to refine my problem-solving skills and expand my knowledge of web development.</p>

                        <h4>NEXT STEPS:</h4>

                        <p>I am continuously improving this weather app and exploring additional features, such as weather forecasts and user account management, 
                        to enhance its functionality. I am also open to collaboration and feedback from the developer community to make this project even better.</p><br>
